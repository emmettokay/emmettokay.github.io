            I value a slowness to life that things like having this website help with. After years of experimentation, I've found I love
            technology, but not its pervasive tendency to steal our time. I've set out on a journey of "Digital Minimalism," which includes
            using a "dumb phone" and limiting screen time as much as possible. <br> <br>
            This site will serve as my "hub." I will update it and continue to build it out while learning about web development in the process. Thanks for being here :)
