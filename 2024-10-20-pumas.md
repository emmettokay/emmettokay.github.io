Before Adidas Sambas were popular, I bought a pair. The same day I received them, I returned them. I feel I have a unique ability to spot which sneakers are going to emerge as the new "it" shoes. I have that feeling about Pumas right now, so I bought a pair. I'm not going to return them this time. Let's revisit this in a year and a half and see if I was right.
